## Scales included

- **scales_included**: both arms at ell_max=460 (matched); BNT cuts bin-1 only, bins 2-4 to 1024

## Caveats (from provenance)

- Both series are calibrated and on-truth (SBC rank-std 0.28-0.29 vs the ideal 0.289; null means within 0.3 sigma of truth), so the FoM difference is a real difference in information, not one posterior being broken.
- The decisive quantity is r(Omega_m, S8). Weak lensing carries a physical degeneracy near -0.9; raw NPE on the ill-conditioned BNT vector returns -0.03, i.e. it loses the degeneracy structure entirely while keeping plausible (even tighter) marginals. That inflates the 3-param volume without widening any 1-D projection.
- SBC and TARP CANNOT see that failure: both test marginal rank uniformity per parameter, so a posterior with correct marginals and missing correlations passes both.
- MOPED is not free where it is not needed: on the well-conditioned non-BNT vector raw NPE is ~20% tighter than MOPED, presumably non-Gaussian information the Gaussian-optimal compression discards.
